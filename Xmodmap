! I use a keyboard with 65 keys, which doesn't have room for an Escape.
! the keyboard comes with a modifier key, and the top left button, instead
! of being $ (or ` on QWERTY), acts as Escape and you need to use the
! modifier key to type the original key. Since I remap the Caps Lock to
! Escape, I don't need this and can remap the top left key back to what
! it should be
! Unfortunately this makes it the wrong key on QWERTY, but you can still
! type the correct one with the modifier key
! This doesn't work (and will never work) in Chrome.
